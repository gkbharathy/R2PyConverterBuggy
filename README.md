# Py_R_Converters
Contains Python 3.5 scripts to convert basic syntax of Python 3.5 to R.

## The goals of this repository are:
* Help R programmers learn Python
* Help convert old cumbersome, but useful R scripts into Python
* Aid in scientific computing as R is more difficult to parallelize than Python

### Scripts In Progress:
* Basic R to Python 3 syntax converter
* Basic Python to R syntax converter (helps R programmers learn Python)

### Scripts to be completed:
* Standard R library usage to Python usage
   - The goal here is to be able to automatically reformat common R function calls into their Python equivalent
     (e.g. nls() to scipy.optimize())
